# homework
## Easy ----
# These problems use the samples from the posterior distribution for the globe tossing example.
# This code will give you a specific set of samples, so that you can check your answers exactly.
# R code:
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 ) 3.27
prior <- rep( 1 , 1000 )
likelihood <- dbinom( 6 , size=9 , prob=p_grid )
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)
set.seed(100)
samples <- sample( p_grid , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=TRUE )

## 3E1 ----
# How much posterior probability lies below p = 0.2?
sum( posterior[p_grid < .2] )

## 3E2 ----
# How much posterior probability lies above p = 0.8?
sum( posterior[p_grid > .8] )

## 3E3 ----
# How much posterior probability lies between p = 0.2 and p = 0.8?
sum( posterior[p_grid < .8 & p_grid > .2] )

## 3E4 ----
# 20% of the posterior probability lies below which value of p?
quantile(x = samples, probs = .2)

## 3E5 ----
# 20% of the posterior probability lies above which value of p?
quantile(x = samples, probs = .8) #?????????

## 3E6 ----
# Which values of p contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability?
library(rethinking)
HPDI(samples = samples, prob = .66)

## 3E7 ----
# Which values of p contain 66% of the posterior probability, 
# assuming equal posterior probability both below and above the interval?
low.p <- ((100-66)/2)/100
high.p <- 1-low.p
quantile(samples, c(low.p, high.p)) # ????

# Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in 15 tosses. 
# Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. 
# Use the same flat prior as before.

# This means simulate the distribution of samples, averaging over the posterior uncertainty in p.
# What is the probability of observing 8 water in 15 tosses?

## 3M5 ----
# Start over at 3M1, but now use a prior that is zero below p = 0:5 and a constant above p = 0:5.
# This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the Earthâ€™s surface is water.
# Repeat each problem above and compare the inferences.
# What difference does the better prior make? If it helps,
# compare inferences (using both priors) to the true value p = 0:7.
